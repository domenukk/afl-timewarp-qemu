# AFL-TimeWarp QEMU

AFL-TimeWarp QEMU is a fork of AFL QEMU Mode with some additional instrumentation.

It allows to fork at any given point in time for AFL-Forkserver.

Currently, it's only tested on x86-64.

To build, call `./build_afl_qemu_support.sh` 
(however you should really only call this if you're inside `AFL/qemu_mode` atm)...

Enjoy :)
